### California Wildfire Data Analytics (1985–2015)

This project analyzes 30 years of California wildfire data (1985–2015) to uncover trends, causes, and potential preventive strategies. Using data from the California Fire Directory (via Cornell’s Virtual Workshop), I performed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and developed key visualizations to support policy and resource allocation decisions.

**Key Findings:**

* **Acres burned are increasing** year over year, indicating worsening fire conditions—possibly due to climate change and urban development.
* **Average fire duration decreased until 2012** but increased afterward, showing reduced containment efficiency.
* **Campfires caused the most damage**, while **lightning was the second most common cause**.
* The **California Department of Forestry** handled the most fires, while **USDA Forest Service** dealt with the most destructive ones on average.

**Recommendations:**

* Invest in **ecological forest restoration** and **firefighting technology**.
* **Restrict campfires** in high-risk areas.
* **Increase funding** to frontline agencies like USDA and CAL FIRE.

Tools used: Excel, pivot tables, data cleaning formulas.
